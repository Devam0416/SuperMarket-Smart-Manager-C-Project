PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project implements a console-based SuperMarket Management System using the C programming language. 
The system supports inventory management, customer shopping flow, cart functionality, and billing with GST. 
It demonstrates structured programming concepts using modular functions, structures, arrays, loops, and switch-case menus.

KEY FEATURES

• Display complete inventory  
• Add a new product (Staff Only)  
• Update product price or stock  
• Case-insensitive product search  
• Add to cart with quantity validation  
• View and remove cart items  
• Billing with GST (18%)  
• Password-protected staff section  

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Software:
• GCC compiler or any C compiler  
• Terminal or command-line interface  

Dependencies:
• stdio.h  
• string.h  
• ctype.h  

HOW TO COMPILE AND RUN

    gcc main.c -o supermarket

Step 2: Run the program  
    ./supermarket

MAIN MENU OPTIONS

1. Customer Section  
2. Staff Section  
3. Billing Section  
4. Exit  

STAFF PASSWORD:
1234

CUSTOMER FEATURES

• View product list  
• Search products by name  
• Add items to cart  
• Remove items from cart

TESTING SUMMARY

• All menu functions tested  
• Invalid input handling verified  
• Quantity validation works correctly  
• Cart operations tested with multiple items  
• Billing GST and totals calculated accurately  

RESULTS

The program performs all required supermarket operations successfully. 
All modules behave as expected, and the system runs without errors. 
It meets the objectives of a small-scale supermarket management system.

CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK

The project demonstrates effective use of structured programming principles. 
Future improvements may include:
• File storage for saving inventory  
• GUI-based interface  
• User authentication  
• Discount and offer system  
• Category-wise product listing
